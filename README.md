# kiet.AI

The objective of this project is to create an artificial intellegence<sup>[1]</sup> that mimics the "memes" and "inside jokes" that Kiet regularly quotes on a daily basis.

## Version 1.0
The AI currently has no self-awareness or "thought" and simply replaces certain nouns with randomly generated nouns from a list of words and phrases Kiet is well known for saying.

## Version 2.0 (PLANNED)
This version will include the use of a neural network to generate original "memes" and "inside jokes" with the use of training data supplied from Kiet himself.

1. Note well that this AI is never going to be classified as "intellegent" by any rational human being.
