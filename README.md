# kiet.AI

The objective of this project is to create an artificial intellegence that mimics the "memes" and "inside jokes" that Kiet Ho regularly quotes on a daily basis.

## Version 1.0
The AI currently has no self-awareness or "thought" and simply replaces certain nouns with randomly generated nouns from a list of words and phrases Kiet is well known for saying.

## Version 2.0 (PLANNED)
This version will include the use of a neural network to generate original "memes" and "inside jokes" with the use of training data supplied from Kiet Ho himself.
